# Mini-Shell
The Mini Shell Project is a command-line interpreter implemented in C, designed to simulate a simplified version of a Unix/Linux shell. It allows users to execute system commands, manage processes, handle input/output redirection, and implement features like piping and signal handling. The project reinforces key concepts of operating systems, process management, system calls, and inter-process communication (IPC).

This shell supports:

Executing built-in and external commands like ls, pwd, mkdir, etc.
Handling foreground and background processes using & for job control.
Piping (|) to connect multiple commands.
Signal handling for terminating or suspending processes.
The project provides hands-on experience in system programming and shell scripting fundamentals, making it a valuable learning tool for understanding how Unix-based shells work.
